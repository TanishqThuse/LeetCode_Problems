    /**Why use / for row and % for column:
    Dividing by m for Row Calculation:

    The row index is determined by how many complete rows fit into the index mid in the conceptual 1D array.
    Since each row contains m columns, dividing the mid index by m (the number of columns) tells you how many full rows the element is past. This gives you the row number. */
       
        /**Modulus % for Column Calculation:

    The column index is determined by the remainder when you divide the index mid by m. This remainder gives the column offset within the row.
    Since the matrix has m columns, the remainder when dividing mid by m indicates the position within the row (i.e., the column). */
